What is Neo4EMF ?
-----------------
This project introduces NEO4EMF, a Neo4j-based model repository and persistence framework allowing on-demand loading, storage, and unloading of large-scale EMF models. Neo4EMF uses a sophisticated unloading approach apart from simple Soft/Weak references. Moreover, Neo4EMF provides a No-SQL database persistence framework based on Neo4j, which is a transactional property-graph database that proved a remarkable running speed for connected data operations compared to relational databases.
